## Inspiration
We wanted to make travelling to the Caribbean easier for tourist as we ourselves understand how hard it is to decide on where to go when travelling especially once you have been traveling for a long time.

## What it does
This chatbot is designed to find the best possible location to travel to in the Caribbean by conversing with the user, gathering their responses, running a filter against all the Caribbean countries and what they offer and best know for. The output for this chatbot is giving the name of the Caribbean country / countries that would best suit their needs as well as a recommended hotel along with the price of said hotel.
